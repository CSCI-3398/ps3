# Problem Set 3: Extracting Speech Features

For the hackathon in a few weeks, you will have to extract features from multiple sound files. This means that you will have to actually write using the Praat scripting language and not just paste the history so that you can:

•	loop through a directory of sound files
•	carry out a bunch of actions on those files (e.g., like extract pitch, extracting shimmer, jitter, htn ratio, formant values for different segments) 
•	save some of the output of those actions to variables
•	print out those values to a file

1. Do a couple more examples like the one above, using the history to create a script.

2. Do the first few activities of the official Praat scripting tutorial here, and then investigate the particular topics of interest (working with variables, reading in and writing out):

3. Spend  time  reading and trying out the code on this particular Praat website page:

4. Experiment with the following script that reads in all the .wav files in a directory and extracts their pitch tracks. Try to combine it with some of the other Praat scripts you've seen so far to extract other sorts of features.
